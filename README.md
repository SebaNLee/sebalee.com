## Personal Website - sebalee.com

Repo to store/host my personal website. Serves both as a portfolio website and has other stuff.

For now, these are the available routes:

`/`: Contains basic introduction and contact information.

`/projects`: Showcase of personal projects with brief summaries.

`/gallery`: Cool photos of cool stuff.

`/lab`: boids-engine project showcase, running in the background with WASM. In the future, this would be a randomized project showcase (TODO).

## Lore

I first started this without a solid idea of what to do, so it was mostly trying out stuff really. But once the idea was solidified it was a smooth coding process in general.

The stack used for this project is React, Next.js, Tailwind (pure CSS for native animations tho). Before working on this, I had an amazing opportunity to learn the essence of webdev from truly great people in my uni working on a project together, so I stuck with the same stack.

I enjoyed coding this more than I initially expected. Regardless, it ended up being a decent project.

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
